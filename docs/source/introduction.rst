What is Modifier Presets?
==========================

Modifier Presets is a Blender add-on designed to simplify the workflow of managing modifiers. It allows users to save and load individual modifiers or entire modifier stacks as presets. This makes it easy to reuse complex modifier setups across different objects and projects.

Why Use Modifier Presets?
==========================

Blenderâ€™s modifiers offer a powerful way to create non-destructive edits, but managing them manually can be time-consuming. Modifier Presets helps by:

- Saving frequently used modifiers for quick reuse
- Applying saved modifier stacks to multiple objects
- Speeding up the modeling workflow with a structured preset system

Who Is It For?
===============

Modifier Presets is ideal for 3D artists, modelers, and animators who frequently use modifiers and want a more efficient way to manage them. Whether you're working on hard surface modeling, procedural designs, or animations, this add-on can streamline your workflow.
