Save modifiers as presets for quick and easy reuse.

**Save as New Preset**
    Click the **Save** button to open a new panel where you can configure the following options:

    - **Name**: Enter a name for your new preset.
    - **Icon (optional)**: Select an icon to represent the preset.

**Overwrite an Existing Preset**
    Hold the ``Shift`` key while clicking the **Save** button to open a list of all saved presets.  
    From the list, select the preset you want to overwrite.

    .. warning::
        Overwriting a preset will permanently replace the existing data. This action cannot be undone.

**Object References**
    Saving a preset will save everything that is connected with any modifier of the active object.
    For example, if you use a ``Mirror`` modifier and have set the ``Mirror Object`` property to another object, this object will also be saved.

    .. note::
        If you do not want object references to be imported every time you use the preset, make sure to save the preset without any object references.
