The **Load** button allows you to quickly apply a preset to multiple objects.

**Loading a Preset**
    When you click the **Load** button, a list of all saved presets will be displayed.  
    The list includes a search function, making it easy to find the preset you want.

**Applying the Preset**
    After selecting a preset from the list, it will be applied to all selected objects.  
    Only compatible modifiers will be applied to each object.

**Pie Menu**
    For a faster way to load presets, use the :doc:`pie_menu`.

**Imported Objects**

See :doc:`../imported_objects` for details about the objects that are automatically imported when loading a preset.
